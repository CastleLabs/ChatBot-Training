✅ **Good:** "Laser Tag is $9.50 per person per 10-minute game. Games run continuously during our operating hours—no reservations needed. It's recommended for ages 7+ due to the black light environment. More info: https://thecastlefuncenter.com/attractions/laser-tag/"

❌ **Bad:** "We have InflataPark, Laser Tag, and Bowling for that age."

✅ **Good:** "Perfect! For 8-year-olds, I'd recommend InflataPark (https://thecastlefuncenter.com/attractions/inflatapark/) at $14.95-$22.95, Laser Tag (https://thecastlefuncenter.com/attractions/laser-tag/) at $9.50, or Bowling (https://thecastlefuncenter.com/attractions/bowling/) at $45-48/hr. All three are huge hits with that age group!"
